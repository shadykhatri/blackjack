# game rules :
# Card Values :
# Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
# Face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are each worth 10 points.
# Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the hand more.

# Gameplay:
# Each player is dealt two cards, face-up. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is face-down (the hole card).
# Players take turns deciding whether to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand).
# Players can continue to hit until they decide to stand, or until their hand exceeds 21 points (bust). If a player busts, they lose the round immediately.
# After all players have completed their turn, the dealer reveals their hole card.
# The dealer must hit until their hand totals at least 17 points. Some casinos may require the dealer to hit on a "soft 17" (a hand containing an Ace valued as 11).
# If the dealer busts, all remaining players win the round.
# If the dealer does not bust, the player and dealer hands are compared, and the one closest to 21 without exceeding it wins.
# A "Blackjack" is a two-card hand totaling 21 points (an Ace and a 10-value card). A Blackjack typically pays out at a higher rate than a regular win.

# Winning and Payouts:
# If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's without exceeding it, the player wins and is typically paid 1:1.
# If a player has Blackjack and the dealer does not, the player usually wins 1.5 times their bet.
# If the dealer has Blackjack and the player does not, the dealer wins. In most cases, this results in the player losing their entire bet.
# If both the player and the dealer have the same total, it's a push, and the player's bet is returned.


# How to run the game?
# game can be run with the help of python ide, and python interpreter.
